# jscodeboard

This is an interactive coding environment. You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.

- Click any text cell to edit it
- The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell!
- You can use any library in npm by importing it
- You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the `show` function. This is a function built into this environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values
- Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right
- Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell

All of your changes get saved to the file you opened jscodeboard with. So if you ran `npx jscodeboard serve test.js`, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the test.js file.
